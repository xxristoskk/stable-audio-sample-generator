# stable-audio-sample-generator
Creating batches of generated audio for the purpose of sampling in music.

There is a Colab Notebook available to start creating samples (recommended if you don't have  a 8gb+ GPU). The CLI allows you to create samples locally.

A HuggingFace token is required, along with [stable-audio-tools](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools/).
